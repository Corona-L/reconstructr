# reconstructr





**Description:**

Reconstructr is simple but effective app that users can utilize to take detailed step-by-step instructions of their DIY projects, builds, recipes, and more. Users can take pictures, record audio notes, and write detailed instructions to make sure that they know what they've done and how to do it again in the future. The steps can also be reversed, so that users can easily put back together what they've taken apart, just in case things have gone wrong.

**How to:**

Open the app, create a log in, and sign in. The home page will be empty at first but you can populate it with your own projects. Once a new project is created, users will be invited to create steps. This process involves taking a picture, recording an optional audio snippet and/or inputting text data. Create as many steps as you need for as many projects as you like!

The toggle button in the top right hand corner will switch the direction of the steps, depending on whether you're creating or deconstructing!
